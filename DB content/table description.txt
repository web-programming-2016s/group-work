
Table "users" is the register for the contestants. Admin is required to divide players into groups 1 and 2. After the registration
players of an ARG are signed in as teammembers of either first or second group. From now on different rules apply to them 
according to the group they are in.

Table "Correct_clues" is linked to the table "users" and contains both correct and fake clues that the users (players) try to get by 
inserting different codes. For the purpose of demonstration the clues are marked as real or fake. During the actual ARG clues will be seemingly 
similar in content and looking plausible.
