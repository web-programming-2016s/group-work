Color messages
By Maria Patrakova

Color Messages is a little app to let users send each other messages in a certain color. 
Users can see the names of the other users, everyone's messages or just serch for their own messages.
Good for kids and young teenagers. It is easy and fun to use. 
If the users agreed on a color code, they can use it to, for example, leave reinders (in red) or wishes (in green).
Unlike real social networks (FB, VK) it does not require registration, just leaving your name so people can address you. 

While working on the project I gained an understanding of how to plan an app, what kind of groundwork to do and what kind of logic to apply, 
i.e. trying to foresee all posible user inputs and app's response.
