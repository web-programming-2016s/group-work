	Teammates: working alone
	
	Purpose of the project: this is an app that is used for playing Alternate Reality Games (ARGs). Two teams each have a username and password.
	Each team is connected to their own DB, which contains all possible codes for according team. 
	
	If team 1 inserts code 1 which matches their DB, their DB
	connects to a table of clues for team 1 and checking IDs sends back a corresponding clue for team 1.
	
	But if team 2 inserts code 1, it doesn't match their DB, so their DB instead of connecting to table of clues for team 2,
	connects to a mutual table of fake clues, and fake clue is chosen randomly from the list and is sent to team 2.
	
	Guided by a fake clue team 2 arrives to a phisycal location where they find a text that says "It's a trap, go back to a previous location and insert a correct code."
	Table of fake clues is the same for both teams.
	
	Description: Target group of this product is anyone (mostly hosts)who is interested in hosting a on-location game (team building, holiday party etc.).
	This app is very simple and is easy to understand and use. It is minimalistic, thus very convenient to use on the mobile platform, as it is meant
	to be opened on mobile phones. 
	After some research some interesting apps popped that are mostly tools for solving ARG puzzles, but not a single one that is meant for organizing
	such activities. So I may assume that my application is not a common one. Here are examples of applications that are meant for ARG use (for players):

	Functionalities:
	-Possible to create a user and have access to additional info as a logged in user
	-Depending on input info, different info is given back (interactivity)
	-App is a systematization of an interactive game (pushes further the gameplay)
	
	Summary: I was surprised analysing the market. I only used two tables, but as it is more practical, I wouldn't change it. Design might be more intricate.
