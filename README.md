		Project - Tix
		Team - Asko Aksel
		Purpose - Trying to create a simple application, with what you can create and attend events.
		Description - The target group for this application, are people, who want to create and attend events, that aren't in any big social media web services like
			    Facebook or Vkontakte. As mentioned, then similar web services that have this application inside of them are Facebook and Vkontakte.
		Functionalities:
				v0.1 Register
				v0.2 Login
				v0.3 Logout
				v0.4 Create event
				v0.5 Delete event
				v0.6 Attend event
				v0.7 Cancel attending


		What I learned from this project is that developing a project to its full potential takes a long time and requires a lot of effort. The thing I'd do differently next time,
		would be to divide my time in a better way.
