"Puppy Calculator" Making counting easy!

The idea and development of webpage author is Tony Haav

My webpage is a universal counter of puppies.
The user has to analyse the puppies and enter the correct number in each bracket.
Notice that the webpage could be used to count other things, 
when replacing the images with example trees or cars. 

Then the need to change the name and some properties of the code, 
taylored specifically regarding the object in question.
Since there are sometimes images where you have objects and you need to store
the information somewhere, than this calculator can come in handy since it has 
a database attribute included. 

There is a webpage see "table" that displays the entries. 
The firs thing that comes to mind is that Facebook actually has a similar website
more specifically Facebook enables users to create similar webpages, in the form of 
Quizzes

Once you have created a quiz, the outcome is fairly similar to "Puppy Calculator"
since there are also images conveyed there and and a need to insert values in order 
for the quiz to give an answer.

During this course, i learned how HTML code is different from PHP.
I learned to use the online repository hosting system "Github" 
and to communicate with it using Putty
i had a chance to use Bootstrap coding and embed a database to my app.
